# Spring Dubbo Distributed REST Service

This project demonstrates best practices for developing **distributed RESTful services** using **Spring Boot** and **Apache Dubbo**. It focuses on building a **high-performance, scalable, and modular microservices architecture** while leveraging Dubbo’s RPC framework for efficient service communication.  

## 🔹 Key Features  
- ✅ **Spring Boot Integration** – Simplifies microservice development and configuration.  
- ✅ **Apache Dubbo for RPC** – Enables high-performance remote procedure calls between services.  
- ✅ **RESTful API Support** – Exposes services as RESTful endpoints for seamless web integration.  
- ✅ **Service Discovery & Registry** – Utilizes **Zookeeper/Nacos** for dynamic service discovery.  
- ✅ **Load Balancing & Fault Tolerance** – Implements Dubbo’s built-in mechanisms for reliability.  
- ✅ **Transaction Management** – Ensures consistency in distributed transactions.  
- ✅ **High Availability** – Uses clustering strategies to improve system resilience.
