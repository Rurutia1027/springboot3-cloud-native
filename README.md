# SpringBoot 3.0 Cloud Native 

This project demonstrates best practices for developing **distributed RESTful services** using **Spring Boot** and **Apache Dubbo**. It focuses on building a **high-performance, scalable, and modular microservices architecture** while leveraging Dubboâ€™s RPC framework for efficient service communication.  

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features  
- âœ… **Spring Boot Integration** â€“ Simplifies microservice development and configuration.  
- âœ… **Apache Dubbo for RPC** â€“ Enables high-performance remote procedure calls between services.  
- âœ… **RESTful API Support** â€“ Exposes services as RESTful endpoints for seamless web integration.  
- âœ… **Service Discovery & Registry** â€“ Utilizes **Zookeeper/Nacos** for dynamic service discovery.  
- âœ… **Load Balancing & Fault Tolerance** â€“ Implements Dubboâ€™s built-in mechanisms for reliability.  
- âœ… **Transaction Management** â€“ Ensures consistency in distributed transactions.  
- âœ… **High Availability** â€“ Uses clustering strategies to improve system resilience.
